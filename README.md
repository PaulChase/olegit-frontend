# Olegit - front end

### The front end for the Olegit app made with Nextjs.

Olegit is app that allows users to verify the authenticity of referral links and websites.

Users will be able to:

* See how many people trusts the website/link
* How many people have voted for the website
* View comments/reviews on the website made by other users.

Still looking for some small cash to host the backend.
